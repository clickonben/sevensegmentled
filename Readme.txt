Edit SevenSegmentLed.cpp and change the number in the LedDisplay enum to match the pins you have wired to each segment of your display.

Create a folder called SevenSegmentLed in your Arduino/Libraries/ directory. 

Copy SevenSegmentLed.h, SevenSegmentLed.cpp and kewords.txt into the folder.

Add #include "SevenSegmentLed.h" to your sketch.

Write code to make flashy numbers appear on your display.

Rinse and repeat.
